- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabmartin.
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, storytelling and filmmaking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS, HTML and Javascript. I discovered programming in university, where I learnt the basics of html and css. 
I also created an RPG 2D game in Unity for my final degree project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that helps me learn new languages or improve my knowledge.
I have a degree in media studies, so I have experience with video editing, screenwriting, marketing plans, brand image, sales pitches and more! 
- 📫 How to reach me: my email is gabmarod@gmail.com
